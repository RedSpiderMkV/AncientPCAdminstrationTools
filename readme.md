AncientPCAdministrationTools
============================

So I have a nice old Pentium 3 laptop still capable of running Xubuntu 14.04 in an acceptable fashion, runs Netbeans 8 and Spyder IDE pretty well at the end of 2015.

Have developed a few tools to make adminstering it easier especially with some of its quirks.

Still runs Visual Studio 2010 just fine on Windows XP and since that's supported until 2020, this little laptop has many years to go.

(Its not my main dev machine, don't worry :P just a little toy I like to keep around and see how far it can be pushed.)
